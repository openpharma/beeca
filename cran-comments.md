* Registered S3 methods

## R CMD check results

0 errors | 0 warnings | 1 note

I am aware of one note: The suggested package 'margins' is no longer available on CRAN. 'margins' is only suggested as it can be used for testing and in a vignette example to demonstrate validation of 'beeca' outputs.

* checking package dependencies ... NOTE
Package suggested but not available for checking: ‘margins’
