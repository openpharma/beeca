## Resubmission

This is a resubmission. In this version I have:

* Corrected URLs, DOIs, ORCID identifiers

* Registered S3 methods

## R CMD check results

0 errors | 0 warnings | 1 note

I am aware of one possible note: The suggested package 'margins' was very recently reinstated to CRAN and binaries may not be available for certain platforms / R versions. At time of submission it is not available for Windows r-devel. 

```
* checking package dependencies ... NOTE
Package suggested but not available for checking: ‘margins’
```
